# Design System Builder
Create complete design systems in minutes

I recently read the great book "Refactoring UI" to learn how to do a better job
at building and designing user interfaces for my projects.

I quickly noticed that putting together a good design system (e.g. colors, font
weights, etc) could benefit greatly from having some tooling that would show you
the current choices, make it easy to change them and lastly export them as CSS
to easily use in your projects. 

My search didn't bring up anything leightweifght that was not a complete UI and 
component mocking tool and/or library, so I decided to build something to match
my needs.

Design System Builder is an attempt at starting such a tool. It currenty only
supports generating color swatch pallets. But it can save them, load them and
export them to CSS. And it gives you a good overview of your current color system.
